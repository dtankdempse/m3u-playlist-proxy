# üé¨ M3U Playlist Proxy

The **M3U Playlist Proxy** is a lightweight and effective tool designed to forward essential headers to proxy M3U playlist streams. Acting as a bridge between your client and the server, it ensures that important headers (such as `User-Agent`, `Referer`, etc.) are accurately passed along. This setup allows IPTV applications to reliably access streams that need specific headers in place.

### üìÇ **Supported Formats**

The M3U Playlist Proxy supports the following M3U formats when looking for the required headers for streaming.:

- **Standard**
- **TiviMate**
- **Kodi**
- **VLC**

You can now use any of these formats when loading playlists into MPP.

## üê≥ Setup with Docker

The M3U Playlist Proxy is also available as a Docker image, allowing you to easily deploy it in a containerized environment. By using Docker, you can quickly start the proxy without needing to install dependencies or manually configure the environment.

### üì• Pulling the Docker Image

To get started, pull the latest version of the M3U Playlist Proxy Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull dtankdemp/m3u-playlist-proxy:latest
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the M3U Playlist Proxy Container

Once you‚Äôve pulled the image, you can start the container using:

```bash
docker run -d -p <port>:4123 dtankdemp/m3u-playlist-proxy:latest
```

This command runs the proxy on port `4123`, allowing your IPTV application to connect to it locally or remotely (depending on your setup) to access M3U playlist streams with the necessary headers correctly forwarded. Adjust the port if needed, based on your environment.
